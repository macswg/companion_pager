Python code to update companion config


This repo is a collection of scripts to update a bitfocus companion config.

Script descriptions:

'companion_navUpdate.py' is used to update the nav buttons across all companion pages.

'companion_pager_v2.py' as of this writing uses the first set of buttons (button 1 and button 9 on the streamdeck) in the example config and creates copies with updated labels and actions. The scipts are currently focused on controlling a Spyder X80.
